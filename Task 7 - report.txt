4. Identified unused or suspicious extensions.
5. Removed unnecessary or suspicious ones.

7. Researched risks of malicious extensions.
8. Documented findings.

Installed Extensions (Before Cleanup):

1. [Extension Name 1] – Status: Kept (reason: trusted and in use).
2. [Extension Name 2] – Status: Removed (reason: not used frequently).
3. [Extension Name 3] – Status: Removed (reason: excessive permissions / poor reviews).
4. [Extension Name 4] – Status: Kept (reason: useful, safe).

Suspicious/Removed Extensions:
